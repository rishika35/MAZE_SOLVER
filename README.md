# MAZE_SOLVER
Maze Solver &amp; Path Visualizer is a C and Python project that generates random mazes using Recursive Backtracking and finds the shortest path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm. BFS ensures solvability, and Pygame provides animated visualization. The project demonstrates core concepts of graph traversal, recursion, and pathfinding algorithms.
